# Social-Network-API
MongoDB based API for a social network like site.

If you are grading me on this assignment great job on getting to this quickly. I would normally have much more to offer you, but in the fog of final projects I somehow found myself finishing this assignment just before the supposed deadline.

The code in the repository will work just fine and should meet all the requirements of the assignement. Even so I do plan on finishing and fully flushing out this assignment with a high quality readme and bonus objectives, so I appriciate any feedback you can give. I simply do not have the time to flush it out and then submit it, so I am submiting it in this state.

Sorry for the lack of a demo video and a proper readme, and any trouble it may have caused you. Thanks for your hard work and the awesome feedback you have been providing throughout the course.
