# Social-Network-API
MongoDB based API for a social network like site.

If you are grading me on this assignment great job on getting to this quickly. I would normally have much more to offer you, but in the fog of final projects I somehow found myself finishing this assignment just before the supposed deadline for all assignements.

The code in the repository should work just fine although I only lightly tested them. I was already up late last night preparing to present my final project today and am now running on fumes as it seems I am up working late for the second night in a row and out fear of not meeting graduation requirements I am going to go ahead and submit it.

Sorry for the lack of a video, and any trouble it caused you. Thanks for your hard work and the awesome feedback you have been providing throughout the course.
