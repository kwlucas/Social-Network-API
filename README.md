# Social-Network-API
MongoDB based API for a social network like site.

The API utilizes express and MongoDB to create the back-end of a social networking site complete with POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users and thoughts(posts). All users can be connected with other users as friends and can send reactions to thoughts(posts).
